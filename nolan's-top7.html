      <div class="top7-card">
        <img src="images/insomnia.jpg" alt="Insomnia Poster">
        <div class="film-details">
          <h2>7. Insomnia</h2>
          <p><strong>Genre:</strong> crime, thriller, psychologic</p>
          <p><strong>Tags:</strong> Alaska, murderer, Al Pacino</p>
          <p class="justification">The second Nolan's film is in the ranking too. A thriller about a policeman who investigating a murderer in Alaska. The Robin Williams and Al pacino chemistry is the real charm of the film, the two main actors carry the film and sublimates the direction of Nolan. </p>

      <div class="top7-card">
        <img src="images/batman-begins.jpg" alt="Batman Begins Poster">
        <div class="film-details">
          <h2>6. Batman Begins</h2>
          <p><strong>Genre:</strong>Action, violence, Drama </p>
          <p><strong>Tags:</strong> initiation, trauma, violence, fantastic</p>
          <p class="justification">The first part of the Batman's trilogy. A film which perfectly introduces the characters and launches the trilogy. The Nolan's style direction shows us that he might just become one of the greatest director of all times. The Christian Bale's performance also makes the film very good.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="top7-card">
        <img src="images/oppenheimer.jpg" alt="Oppenheimer Poster">
        <div class="film-details">
          <h2>5. Oppenheimer</h2>
          <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Historic, Biopic, Drama</p>
          <p><strong>Tags:</strong> WW2, Manhattan project, trahison, communsism</p>
          <p class="justification"> A biopic about the father of the atomic bomb. A very good film despite its length, the Cillian Murphy's performance is perfect and the direction is particularly meticulous. Nolan managed to reinvent himself with a type of film he has never experienced before.

      <div class="top7-card">
        <img src="images/the-prestige.jpg" alt="The Prestige Poster">
        <div class="film-details">
          <h2>4. The Prsetige</h2>
          <p><strong>Genre:</strong>Mystery, Drama, Sci-Fi</p>
          <p><strong>Tags:</strong> mystery, end of 19th century, rivalry, magic </p>
          <p class="justification">An excellent film about the rise of the magicians at the end of the 19th century. Ready to do anything to win the rivalry between two old friends turns into a run for the best invention.A very good film with an incredible casting and a very solid story, even if it falls short of the first three films, this film uses to perfection the 19th century atmosphere for a great film.</p>

      <div class="top7-card">
        <img src="images/interstellar.jpg" alt="Interstellar Poster">
        <div class="film-details">
          <h2>3. Interstellar</h2>
          <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Sci-fi, Adventure, Drame</p>
          <p><strong>Tags:</strong> Space travel, complexity, black hole, mystery</p>
          <p class="justification">This film comes from another dimension, probably the craziest film of Nolan. An adventure which explores the space travel and which uses all of our theories about the black Hole, the wormholes ... Nolan has consulted many astrophysicists for this films and the result is just crazy. </p>

      <div class="top7-card">
        <img src="images/inception.jpg" alt="Inception Poster">
        <div class="film-details">
          <h2>2. Inception</h2>
          <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Sci-fi, action, Mystery</p>
          <p><strong>Tags:</strong> dreams, DiCaprio, action, memory</p>
          <p class="justification">A crazy film about the dreams control. Christopher Nolan uses the idea of dreams to its full potential. An incredible story with a 5 stars casting (DiCaprio, Cillian Murphy, Michael Caine, Ken Watanabe ...) which works perfectly in this film. Also note the incredible special effects, probably among the best ever made.</p>

      <div class="top7-card">
        <img src="images/the-dark-knight.jpg" alt="The Dark Knight Poster">
        <div class="film-details">
          <h2>1. The Dark knight (2008)</h2>
          <p><strong>Genre:</strong> action, crime, thriller</p>
          <p><strong>Tags:</strong> batman, violence, justice, chaos</p>
          <p class="justification">The best super-heroes film ever made. This film is just perfect whether it's the acting or the direction, everything is perfect in this film and the performance of Health Ledger comes from another planet.</p>

      <div class="top7-card">
        <img src="images/memento.jpg" alt="Memento Poster">

          <h2>Honorable mention : Memento</h2>
          <p><strong>Genre:</strong> thriller, crime, Mystery</p>
          <p><strong>Tags:</strong> violence, memory, action, Guy Pearce</p>
          <p class="justification">I know I could have put this film in the ranking. This film is also very good but I have finally chosen Insomnia because I have a better feeling with it and I think these two films are quite similar in terms of quality.</p>
